Information theory involves the qualification of information. Closely related is coding theory which is used to design efficient and reliable data transmission and storage methods . Here is a simple circle of continuous topics.

Mathematical Logic
Logic is the study of the principles of valid reasoning and inference.
The study of mathematical proof is particularly important in logic , and has applications to automated theorem proving and formal verification of software.
